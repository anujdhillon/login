This project offers -->

1. Easy exchange of Company logos.
2. Google Login support
3. Facebook Login support
4. Manual login with validated forms. API used as of now is Reqres API for validation.
5. Bootstrap css
6. Responsive across all screens.

In the project directory, type in the command line:
 `npm install`
 `npm start`

This will run the application in developer mode.

Since the manual form registration is validated by reqres API, it only supports a few emails of its members. eg, george.bluth@reqres.in

There are comments in App.js to guide you through the working of the app.
